# The auto-complete exercise

Auto-complete is when a user will provide some arbitrary list of characters and a list of possible results is returned. Some auto-complete implementations can have a contains type behaviour where the list of characters occur anywhere in the result and some have simpler logic where the list of characters occur only from the beginning of the result.

This repository has my auto-complete implementations for different languages. Starting off with the simpler type of auto-complete behaviour to the more advanced.
